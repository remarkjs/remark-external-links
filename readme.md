# remark-external-links

**Stability: Legacy**.
This package is no longer recommended for use.
It’s still covered by semantic-versioning guarantees and not yet deprecated,
but use of this package should be avoided.
Please use `remark-rehype` to move from remark (markdown) to rehype (HTML)
and then replace `remark-external-links` with
[`rehype-external-links`][rehype-external-links].

Legacy [documentation for this package](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-external-links/tree/307f8dc)
is still available in Git.
